# point-cloud-to-image
a simple c project that projects points from a point cloud into a plane and saves an image

I wrote this app during 2004 for a small archeological project that wanted to generate images directly from point clouds
The inputs are the
- point cloud itself 
- the orientation of an image in space

an example of the orientation is the following

```image5 2573.94 10.2688 7.35163 -2.98262e-008 4.9014e-015 1296 972 2195.06 1764.61 17469.2 1.23922 11.9006 0.415454```

I made some improvements to the project because but also created a more modern version of it in Rust.
